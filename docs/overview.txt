The systemdocs module contains the code to parse the API code and database
structure into the database for faster searching and retrieval.  All code
is parsed and documentation extracted.

This module does not currently handle any documentation for the javascript UI.

The information parsed into the database is used to generate the API
documentation on the master website.

**Note** Currently this module is only accessible to the sysadmins, and 
is not published as part of the API.
